## Synopsis

A simple & minimalist e-commerce accelerator store built with ReactJS, Redux, and Bootstrap 4.

* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for state management
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive look & feel
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) with Async/Await (ES8) as a Promise based HTTP client 
* [Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) as a middleware for Redux
